# üîç Test Design Techniques

Here I would like to showcase some of the test design techniques I decided to use for testing the webstore [Demoshopping.ru](https://demoshopping.ru/). All documentation is written in Russian language demonstrating my ability to use it as second language.
1. [Testing the Registration Form. Equivalence Partitioning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkUJtjhiKJMQWLJzGnw9ePbWF7ftE1zZ6P61_MAmhuY/edit?usp=sharing)

   Conducting testing of the login "–õ–æ–≥–∏–Ω" and password "–ü–∞—Ä–æ–ª—å" fields on the registration page for compliance with validation requirements and creating a table taking into account equivalence classes and boundary values.
   
3. [Filtering and Sorting Testing. Pairwise Testing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Orz3g5ZnWSR2uNo9EYwb-a1nA3feABGb4UFHM4MKjjw/edit?usp=sharing)

   Conducting testing of the filtering and sorting functions using the "Pairwise Testing" technique.

5. [Testing of the Paypal payment module. Decision Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D5pTAtbt142kXim8FRawDtvthkM77r5g8LduyFo-Ih0/edit?usp=sharing)
